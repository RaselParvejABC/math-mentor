            prove its claim of some resource to the issuer, client sends the

          How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?

            Node works in asynchronous nature and driven by events. Its
            operations are non-blocking. It does not block the main thread by
            waiting for some work to complete first. Rather, registering a
            callback to its completion event, it proceed to the next task.
            That's why node is great for I/O intensive Applications.
          </Typography>
          <Typography className="mb-4" variant="paragraph">
            When NodeJS receives multiple requests, it places the requests into
            Event Queue. Node has an Event Loop, that keeps an eye on the main
            thread and event queue. Whenever Event Loop sees an task on event
            queue is completed and main thread is empty, it takes the task from
            the from the event queue and execute its callback on main thread,
            thus serving the requests.
